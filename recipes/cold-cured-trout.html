    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb fresh trout fillets, skin on</li>
      <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp crushed juniper berries</li>
      <li>1 tbsp crushed black pepper</li>
      <li>1 large bunch fresh dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, crushed juniper berries, and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the dill on a large piece of plastic wrap. Place the
        trout fillets skin-side down on the dill, and then cover the fillets
        with the salt mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the trout with the remaining dill and wrap the plastic wrap tightly
        around the fillets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the wrapped trout on a tray or dish and refrigerate for 24-48
        hours, turning the fillets every 12 hours to ensure even curing.
      </li>
      <li>
        After curing, remove the trout from the plastic wrap and gently scrape
        off the dill and curing mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thinly slice the cold-cured trout and serve on rye bread or crispbread
        with a dollop of mustard sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
